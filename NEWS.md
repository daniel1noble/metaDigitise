Version 1.0.0
First release of metaDigitise

Version 1.0.1
- Added stringsAsFactors = TRUE to all data.frame, as.data.frame and any read.* functions to be explicit in anticipation for R 4.0.0 release and updates.

Version 1.0.2
- Issues with mockery package being deprecated. Need to change mock tests but documentation is unclear so dropping tests for now. Will revisit in future update.
